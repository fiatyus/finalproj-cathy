The data set  compares Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial (Blue Cross Blue Shield) reimbursement rates for different orthopedic CPT codes. The data  outlines how much a physician would get reimbursed through different insurances for the same procedure.

The analysis in the report looks at the average reimbursements, and other descriptive statistics, for each insurance within orthopedics. It also compares Medicare as a function of Medicaid, in an attempt to examine their correlation.

``` {r, global-chunks, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE
)
```

```{r, load data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages('readxl', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
library(readxl)
here::i_am("code/maketable.R")
data <- read_excel(file.path(here::here("data"), "cptcodes.xlsx"))
```
